## Number Guessing Game ##

A number guessing game in C++ is a simple console-based game where the computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player attempts to guess that number. The computer provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct. This type of game is often used as a beginner's project to learn basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and random number generation.

## Key Concepts Covered ##

**Random Number Generation:**

Use the rand() function to generate a random number.
Use srand() to seed the random number generator with time(0) for better randomness.

**User Input**:

Use cin to get input from the user.'

**Loops:**

Use a loop (e.g., while or do-while) to allow multiple guesses until the correct number is guessed.

**Conditionals:**

Use if statements to compare the user's guess with the target number and provide feedback.
